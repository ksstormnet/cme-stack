## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The CME stack is built using **five modular Docker Compose configurations** that can be deployed independently or together based on environment needs:

### Compose Configurations

| Configuration | Purpose | Primary Services | Typical Use |
|---------------|---------|------------------|-------------|
| **docker-compose.core.yml** | Essential business services | WordPress, Matomo, n8n | Development, minimal production |
| **docker-compose.infrastructure.yml** | Development & operations | GitLab, GlitchTip, tools | Full development environment |
| **docker-compose.monitoring.yml** | Observability stack | Prometheus, Grafana, Loki | Production monitoring |
| **docker-compose.dev.yml** | Development overrides | Volume mounts, debug configs | Local development |
| **docker-compose.staging.yml** | Staging environment | Production-like configs | Pre-production testing |

### Core Services

| Service | Purpose | Technology | External Access |
|---------|---------|------------|-----------------|

## üîß Development Workflow

### Environment Management

The CME stack supports three primary environments with different service configurations:

- **Development** - Core services with file mounting and debug configurations
- **Staging** - Production-like configuration for pre-deployment testing  
- **Production** - Full service stack with monitoring and high availability

### Service Management Commands

```bash
# Core development environment
./scripts/compose-dev.sh dev                 # Start core services only
./scripts/compose-dev.sh staging             # Staging-like environment

# Service group management
./scripts/compose-dev.sh start core          # WordPress, Matomo, n8n
./scripts/compose-dev.sh start infrastructure # GitLab, GlitchTip
./scripts/compose-dev.sh start monitoring    # Prometheus, Grafana, Loki

# Monitoring and debugging
./scripts/compose-dev.sh logs [service]      # View service logs
./scripts/compose-dev.sh health              # Health check all services
./scripts/compose-dev.sh down               # Clean shutdown
```

### Git Branching Strategy

- **main** - Production-ready code, deployed via GitHub Actions to production
- **staging** - Pre-production testing, deployed to staging environment
- **dev** - Active development integration, continuous deployment to dev
- **feature/*** - Feature development branches
- **chore/*** - Infrastructure and maintenance tasks

### Source Control Strategy

- **GitHub** - Primary repository hosting with GitHub Actions for production CI/CD
- **GitLab (Development Only)** - Local development GitLab for CI/CD pipeline development and testing
- **Deployment Flow** - GitLab CI/CD handles staging deployments, GitHub Actions handles production

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collection

- **Business Metrics** - Visitor conversion rates, booking pipeline, revenue attribution
- **System Metrics** - Container resources, database performance, API response times
- **Application Metrics** - WordPress performance, n8n workflow success rates
- **Infrastructure Metrics** - Network throughput, storage utilization, service health

### Error Tracking & Logging

- **GlitchTip** - Centralized exception tracking across all services
- **Loki** - Structured log aggregation with label-based querying
- **Service Logs** - Individual service logging with consistent formatting

### Dashboard Access

- **Grafana**: Primary dashboard interface for all metrics visualization
- **Prometheus**: Direct access to metrics and alerting rules
- **GlitchTip**: Error tracking and performance monitoring

## üîê Security & Privacy

### Privacy Compliance
- **GDPR/CCPA Compliant** - Complete visitor data ownership through self-hosted analytics
- **No Third-Party Tracking** - All analytics and monitoring remain within infrastructure
- **Data Residency** - Full control over data location and retention policies

### Security Architecture
- **Network Isolation** - Services communicate through defined Docker networks
- **Secrets Management** - 1Password Connect integration for credential security
- **SSL Termination** - Reverse proxy handles all external SSL/TLS
- **Principle of Least Privilege** - Services only access required resources

## üìö Documentation

- **[Development Setup](DEVELOPMENT-SETUP.md)** - Complete environment setup instructions
- **[Architecture Overview](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Detailed technical architecture and service interactions
- **[Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Production deployment procedures and workflows

## ü§ù Development Process

### Implementation Workflow

1. **Branch Creation** - Create feature/chore branch from `dev`
2. **Service Development** - Develop with live file mounting in dev environment
3. **Integration Testing** - Test service interactions and data flows
4. **Health Validation** - Run health checks and monitoring verification
5. **Documentation Updates** - Update relevant documentation for changes
6. **Staging Deployment** - Deploy to staging for pre-production testing
7. **Production Release** - Merge to main and deploy to production

### Quality Standards

- **Configuration Completeness** - All Docker Compose services include comprehensive configuration
- **Health Monitoring** - All services provide health check endpoints
- **Documentation Currency** - Changes include corresponding documentation updates
- **Security Review** - All configurations follow security best practices
- **Environment Parity** - Configurations work consistently across dev/staging/production
